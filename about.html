          <p>This site is a celebration of works in progress. Of youth. Of not knowing the outcome and having still the courage to start. To set sail.</p>
          <p>Average is an evolution of the French word avarie. The term was used as an estimate of the damage to goods sustained while at sea. Indeed. We are damaged goods.</p>
          <p>We are average. We are not special. And we are creating. Out of our brokenness we let flow our reality and, by the grace of God, our reality hopes to become more than brokenness. In the words of Madeleine L'Engle, we hope to find &ldquo;Cosmos in the chaos.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>It is important to understand that great things don&rsquo;t just happen. The first draft is never great. The first novel is never great. The first sketch is never great. The next couple drafts are rarely much better. It takes discipline and work to even get to a place where greatness is a possibility. So, in order to one day have a shot at greatness, we must begin.</p>
          <p>This site is about beginning, and process and grace.</p>
          <p>Hopefully you, dear reader, will enjoy our Avarie. Our average. Our work in progress. Not complete but striving to be. Not perfect, and never quite to be, but always getting there.</p>
          <p>So, what is our goal?</p>
          <p>Simply to create and to share and in so doing become better than we were.</p>

            <p>Bradley DeYoung- The Artiste</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a Boulder Colorado based artist currently attending school in southern Tennessee. My works in media range from Ink, conte, graphite, watercolor, to acrylics. I am currently studying art with an emphasis in art education. I am an avid backpacker and hiker and I find myself drawing a lot of inspiration from the outdoors and natural environments! My work on The Avarie is comprised mainly of sequential art pieces that are meant to push our collective story along. I am heavily influenced by Conceptual and sequential art.</p>

          <p>Phillip Ward- The Wordsmith</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like quiet corners of dusty libraries, music, good books (especially those that aren't "true"), indie films and pour overs. I am currently in San Diego studying to become an engineering physicist. I like to explore and, out of everywhere I've been, I seem to get lost most often in my own mind. My life goal is to do cool things with people I love.</p>

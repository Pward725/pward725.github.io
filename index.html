          <h3>The Tinkerer</h3>
          <h5>By: Bradley Deyoung and Phillip Ward</h5>
        <div class="words">
          <p>Chapter 1</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;The tired old Tinkerer held his creation up to the light and sighed. It was the sound of something falling into place that previously, frustratingly had absolutely refused to do so. A few golden beams came from high in the workshop somewhere and penetrated the darkness, illuminating the chaos of a space made for creating. The most notable aspect of the space was the number and variety of mechanical parts scattered across every nook and cranny of the workshop. Over here were boxes of gears in all different sizes. Over there, on a wooden workbench, mounded high like a desert sand dune, were thousands of tiny golden wings. The stone walls were dotted with dim lamps that exuded a warm bronze light that didn&rsquo;t do much by way of illumination but made the place feel less like a cave and more like a room. The lamps were spaced evenly, interrupted only by two oak doors that sat facing each other across the workshop. Strewn across the floor were various cranks and levers, axels and wheels and, framed by a box of golden light, a shadow. Shaped like a boy. Moving.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; The cry echoed through the workshop, quiet but for the soft click and whir of moving gears. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; muttered the Tinkerer who had knelt on the hard stone floor and placed his creation, the source of the aforementioned shadow, on the ground in front of him. He reached forward and inserted a key into the area where a neck would be on this small automaton. The tinkerer gave three good twists, removed the key, and gave the machine a sharp tap on the top of the head. The Tinkerer stood up and watched as his creation began to move about the workshop. While movement is a functional description of the activity in which the small automaton was now engaged, perhaps a more accurate phrase would be toddling. It was an odd sight, almost eerie, startlingly human. Even more alarming perhaps was the look of fatherly pride in the Tinkerer&rsquo;s eyes. It didn&rsquo;t seem possible but, whenever the automaton would come close to a pile of wheels or the leg of a table, it turned around and walked away. It acted as if it could see, which of course, was preposterous.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;After a few minutes of this the Tinkerer cleared his throat and, in the quietness of this small, dark workshop, the automaton stopped to listen. It stared like a curious child at the source of the noise and after a few moments tilted its head.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo; came the deep, slightly husky voice of the Tinkerer. It sounded like aged whiskey. The automaton took a few steps toward the voice and then stopped and issued what sounded like the soft tinkle of small bells brushed by a faint breeze. While not words, the notes sounded like a question and the Tinkerer laughed.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Do you know who you are?&rdquo; questioned the Tinkerer. This time the notes sounded sad, and the rigid metal of the automaton seemed to soften and droop slightly.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the Tinkerer stroking his long, white beard absentmindedly. With a swiftness that belied his age, he turned and strode over to a workbench covered in parchment on which were intricate designs. He picked a couple up and glanced over them, his brow furrowed in concentration. Then, in another burst of movement, he crossed over to a small oak door and wrenched it open, a cascade of light flooding the darkness.</p>

            <p>Chapter 2</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The automaton edged forward to the balcony railing and looked out over the city. It sat nestled in the shoulder of a mountain pass, pressed close to granite walls, as if hiding. A crystal-clear stream wandered around its outskirts, making a lazy half circle before cascading, in a frenzy of white foam, down the rest of the mountain. The river was spanned by several bridges that carried empty roads away from the city and deeper into the mountains. It should have been a beautiful place but something subtle and inscrutable, like an unreachable itch, kept it from such a distinction. In some ways, the city looked too big for itself, like an overstretched wineskin now sitting empty and distorted.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; Came the voice of the Tinkerer. The automaton issued a jumble of low notes in response. They were awe and apprehension</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Precisely what I was thinking,&rdquo; agreed the Tinkerer who was now also watching the city below. The furrows on his face deepened as the tired sight of a decaying city struggled against the surfacing memories of this place in its youth. Behind the startling blue of his eyes, new buildings that smelled of freshly cut pine fought with the reality of sagging roofs and pungent mildew below. The excited chatter of voices at market was drowned out by the silence of empty street corners. The few villagers that remained, moved around with shoulders hunched and feet dragging as if carrying the weight of some unknown heavy thing. The Tinkerer&rsquo;s eyes came to rest on yet another family towing their possession-filled cart away from the city. With their departure, his pristine remembrances turned and fled back into the darker, dustier corners of his mind. He sighed, this time it was heavy and dark, like a cough that has settled in the lungs.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;As he turned to go back inside, he stopped, some far off movement catching his eye. Curiosity aroused, the Tinkerer hurriedly grabbed a looking glass from inside and brought it to his eye. In the distance, he could distinguish a small party of mounted travelers on the road that led from the Capital. The Tinkerer tensed, keeping his eye pressed to the glass. The advancing party seemed mostly unremarkable, they were dressed warmly for the mountain pass, their horses looked tired but well cared for, their packs well provisioned. Nothing obviously set them apart, or marked them special. Nothing aside from the fact that they were all women and, as the Tinkerer noticed with a gasp, their eyes were all a shade of deep, molten gold. He collapsed the looking glass with a quick movement of his wrist and looked down at the little automaton. Things were happening. Fast.</p>

          <p>Chapter 3</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Are you sure Theodora?&rdquo; The question came from one of the three travelers with grey cloaks and golden eyes.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, of course I&rsquo;m sure. I haven&rsquo;t felt such a strange Presence since I was a girl,&rdquo; replied Theodora, the last uttered more to herself than her companions, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no coincidence that it&rsquo;s here of all cities.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why are we here, then, if you already know? We can do nothing. The Compact forbids it.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The Compact? What is the Compact but an ineffectual piece of parchment filled with the scribbles of scared men?&rdquo; Theodora responded, gazing distractedly at the city ahead.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;But Thea, what about your uncle?&rdquo; chimed in the other traveler. This remark was met with a tense silence. Theodora turned to the speaker, her motion the bad kind of quiet.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;And what about my uncle?&rdquo; She asked.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;Well&hellip;he has forbidden us! We shouldn&rsquo;t even be here. If we are found out, we will be sent back to the Dungeons!&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;Oh Elayne, you simple girl. You disappoint me. We exist to control, not to be controlled. We serve my uncle because he is a convenient ally. Nothing more. He should lie awake at night sweating with the knowledge that we are free and there is nothing and no one that can stop us. You would do well to remember that.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Elayne responded, head bowed.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;Come. We must make it to the city before the sun goes down.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; As the Sisters continued down the mountain path towards the city, there was something subtle in the way they existed that was dark, that made the very mountains around them seem to shrink away in trepidation. Nothing was obviously wrong about them, indeed upon initial observation it would be excusable to mistake them for an unexceptional group of weary travelers. But on closer inspection, such an evaluation became impossible.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;First, and most obvious, were their golden eyes. Second, was the way the moved. Like snakes swimming through murky water. It looked almost like walking but it was impossible to discern distinct feet or individual steps, their lower halves confusingly disjoint, yet somehow connected. It was like the way everything in a dream can suddenly transform with no loss of continuity. Here one moment, there the next, the in between a jumpy sequence of moments that only barely fit together. Movement like the shadows from a flickering torch. Sinister.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; Before long they were at the city gate. It was a large thing, a pastiche of old oak and wrought iron and, like everything else in the city, seemed to remember grander days. As they passed through, Theodora did something with her hand, and a shimmer flew from her fingertips up to the archway above their heads. As she did this she turned to her companions and spoke.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;Secure the rest of the gates Sisters. No one can know we were here.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; Guinevere and Elayne bowed, turned, and disappeared into the growing darkness.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; The liveliest part of town, indeed the only part of town that showed any signs of life, was the Goat&rsquo;s Head Inn and Pub. It was toward this cacophony of light and sound that Theodora was headed. When she arrived, she stopped just outside the ring of light that spilled out onto the street and brought out from under her robe a golden locket on a golden chain.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;She brought it up to her face slowly, reverently, and blew on it, like she was dusting off an old parchment volume. It sprang open with a faint click and she took out the little ring hidden within. With one hand, she held the ring up to the light while with the other she closed the locket and restored it to its place under her robe.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;The ring was beautiful. Cast in some sort of burnished silver, it seemed to glow a pale blue in the soft light of the rising moon. It was unornamented aside from a single copper gear that sat atop it like a sparkling diamond. As she slid the ring on her finger, the gear started rotating in an ever-faster whir until it was a golden blur. She flipped her hand over so that the palm was facing up, a soft white mist slithering from her fingertips, obscuring her hand, shimmering faintly in the night. With a flex of her hand, the mist collapsed down suddenly into a swirling orb above her palm. With a look at the lonely tower that rose above the city in its silent watch, she tossed the orb in the open door.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been far too long my brother,&rdquo; Theodora muttered into the night.</p>

          Chapter 4

          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;"We will be needing them quite soon," said the Tinkerer as he
            hoisted the automaton onto the platform next to the machine that rested in
            a cloud of billowing steam. "Stand still."
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;He walked to the machine, pulled a couple levers and stood back as the big
            gears on the side slowly rumbled to life. They moved slowly at first and
            then, as they picked up speed, became a low thrum more felt than heard.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;The Tinkerer grabbed a helmet like object and fit it onto his head. It was
            a strange looking apparatus with magnifying glasses of varying strengths
            that sprouted like wings from its sides. He thumbed one down over his eyes
            and knelt in front of the automaton. Reaching toward its neck he pressed a
            small button and the automaton&#8217;s face swung up on a hinge to reveal a
            stunningly intricate network of gears and springs, pistons and crankshafts.
            It was its own microcosm, inhabited by inextricably linked worlds of
            mechanical complexity. Indeed, it was hard to imagine how such a thing was
            conceived, much less made manifest, by a human mind. The Tinkerer took a
            set of tweezers out of his breast pocket and got to work. He prodded a gear
            here, stretched a spring there, consulted the sheets of blueprints laying
            on the platform and sighed. Sometimes he wished things would just work.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;He stood up and grabbed one of the instruments hanging by rubber hoses
            connected to the big machine. It was a strange looking device, reminiscent
            of a crossbow but instead of bowstave and bolt it had two small brass tanks
            and an adjustable nozzle device. A Low Impact Non-temporal Kathorimetric
            Energy Resonator. Linker for short. The Tinkerer consulted some sort of
            gauge mounted on one of the small tanks and apparently satisfied, gave the
            trigger a test squeeze. A spray of white mist ballooned out from the
            nozzle, rustling the blueprints at his feet. Incredibly, instead of
            settling back down like one might expect, the blueprints remained in the
            air, floating lazily, suspended in time. This was apparently expected
            because the Tinkerer did not react except to motion them higher where they
            could be more easily consulted.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Turning back to the automaton, he pulled the trigger again and sprayed a
            rather large cloud of the white mist into the automaton's head. It
            settled around the intricate mechanisms like fog on a cold morning. He
            released the Linker back to its hanging position and stepped back to the
            edge of the platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;The Tinkerer took a deep breath and brought his hands together in front of
            his face as if praying. He closed his eyes and the workshop seemed to hold
            its breath. In one smooth motion he brought his hands apart like he was
            readying an orchestra for the downbeat of their first song. As he did so,
            the entire contents of the automaton's head expanded outward to form
            a majestic constellation of sparkling metal. What was once contained in
            about the volume of a melon, now floated lazily above the entire platform.
            The Tinkerer made a little motion with his hands, like he was tying off an
            imaginary bow, and pulled out his tweezers and tiny scalpel. He moved
            through the now floating gears, inspecting each mechanism in turn, stopping
            now and again to scrape some rust off a small gear or pour some oil on a
            sticky axle.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;As the Tinkerer worked, his body seemed to relax, the tension in his
            shoulders melting away, his movements morphing into a sort of dance. The
            scalpel in one hand and tweezers in the other, he worked his way deeper
            into the complex machinery, progress marked by a trail of slowly spinning
            gears.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Eventually, the Tinkerer reached the center of the automaton's "brain".
            Floating in front of him was an orb of swirling white similar to the mist
            he had sprayed earlier, but more refined, more powerful somehow. Pocketing
            his tweezers, the Tinkerer took a deep breath and, extending his fingers
            toward the orb, summoned the material into his palm.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;With a frown, the Tinkerer noticed an area of swirling blackness slowly
            seeping into the rest of the orb. He grabbed the Linker again and twisted a
            couple gears on the nozzle. He pulled the trigger and instead of a fine
            spray, the white mist came out in a focused jet. He brought it up to the
            orb in his hand and with a quick, precise motion carved out the offending
            material. Letting go of the Linker he gathered the blackness into his free
            hand. One hand Black the other White. He released the White back to its
            position inside the automaton's brain. The Black was more troubling.
            Stroking his mustache, the Tinkerer contemplated the swirling darkness in
            front of him. It wasn't nearly so well behaved as the white
            substance. It flowed chaotically across the top of his skin like ants whose
            home had just been stepped on.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;He grabbed the Linker again, this time toggling a valve that connected the
            nozzle to the tanks. The Tinkerer brought it up to the inky substance,
            pulled the trigger and watched as it was sucked into the brass tanks and
            then through the tubes connecting it to the big machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;Brow furrowed in thought, the Tinkerer wandered through the gears. Why had
            it decayed that fast? Something wasn't right. It was an itch at the
            back of his mind just out of reach. Frustrated and out of time he lifted a
            hand and snapped his fingers. The gears collapsed back into the
            automaton's head, seamlessly resuming their complex blur of motion.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;"How's that?" asked the Tinkerer after he re-latched the
            automaton's face. The automaton gave a little start and a disoriented
            tinkle of bells as its body came back together. It swiveled its head back
            and forth slowly, disoriented, like it had just woken from a nap, and began
            walking around the platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;&#8220;It&#8217;ll have to do. Our time has come.&#8221;
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;With those words that were both a beginning and an ending, he began dashing
            around the workshop, throwing things into a leather satchel. He
            wasn&#8217;t at all sure what he might need, and he was certain to forget
            something important but time was of the essence. Eventually, he had
            gathered up everything he could think of, or more accurately everything he
            could fit, and made his way over to a bronze cage suspended above a deep
            shaft by a complex series of weights and pulleys.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;&#8220;Come along now, we&#8217;ve no time to waste,&#8221; said the
            Tinkerer to the automaton, which was wandering in aimless circles around
            the workshop. At the sound of his voice, the automaton stopped and turned
            to look at him.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;&#8220;Oh dear. We&#8217;re not ready are we, my little friend?&#8221;
            asked the Tinkerer to the automaton. Unfazed, it made its&#8217; way toward
            the Tinkerer with the na&#239;ve excitement known only to children and
            pets. It was almost to him when it stopped abruptly in front of a staff of
            solid oak leaning against a nondescript work bench. It tilted its head,
            looked to the Tinkerer, looked back at the staff and then reached out a
            hand to take hold of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;&#8220;Well now. I almost completely forgot that! This mightn&#8217;t be a
            complete disaster after all.&#8221;
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;The automaton staggered the rest of the way over, veering crazily under the
            awkward weight of the staff. The Tinkerer bent down and gathered both into
            the cage with him. He pulled a lever and they began to descend.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;&#8220;I do hope this isn&#8217;t the last time I will see this place. I
            have developed quite a soft spot for it.&#8221; The Tinkerer trailed off.
            In response, the automaton issued a soft, sad tinkle of bells. And then it
            was quiet as the two unlikely companions were swallowed slowly by darkness.

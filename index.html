          <h3>The Tinkerer</h3>
          <h5>By: Bradley Deyoung and Phillip Ward</h5>
        <div class="words">
          <p>Chapter 1</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;The tired old Tinkerer held his creation up to the light and sighed. It was the sound of something falling into place that previously, frustratingly had absolutely refused to do so. A few golden beams came from high in the workshop somewhere and penetrated the darkness, illuminating the chaos of a space made for creating. The most notable aspect of the space was the number and variety of mechanical parts scattered across every nook and cranny of the workshop. Over here were boxes of gears in all different sizes. Over there, on a wooden workbench, mounded high like a desert sand dune, were thousands of tiny golden wings. The stone walls were dotted with dim lamps that exuded a warm bronze light that didn&rsquo;t do much by way of illumination but made the place feel less like a cave and more like a room. The lamps were spaced evenly, interrupted only by two oak doors that sat facing each other across the workshop. Strewn across the floor were various cranks and levers, axels and wheels and, framed by a box of golden light, a shadow. Shaped like a boy. Moving.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; The cry echoed through the workshop, quiet but for the soft click and whir of moving gears. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; muttered the Tinkerer who had knelt on the hard stone floor and placed his creation, the source of the aforementioned shadow, on the ground in front of him. He reached forward and inserted a key into the area where a neck would be on this small automaton. The tinkerer gave three good twists, removed the key, and gave the machine a sharp tap on the top of the head. The Tinkerer stood up and watched as his creation began to move about the workshop. While movement is a functional description of the activity in which the small automaton was now engaged, perhaps a more accurate phrase would be toddling. It was an odd sight, almost eerie, startlingly human. Even more alarming perhaps was the look of fatherly pride in the Tinkerer&rsquo;s eyes. It didn&rsquo;t seem possible but, whenever the automaton would come close to a pile of wheels or the leg of a table, it turned around and walked away. It acted as if it could see, which of course, was preposterous.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;After a few minutes of this the Tinkerer cleared his throat and, in the quietness of this small, dark workshop, the automaton stopped to listen. It stared like a curious child at the source of the noise and after a few moments tilted its head.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo; came the deep, slightly husky voice of the Tinkerer. It sounded like aged whiskey. The automaton took a few steps toward the voice and then stopped and issued what sounded like the soft tinkle of small bells brushed by a faint breeze. While not words, the notes sounded like a question and the Tinkerer laughed.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Do you know who you are?&rdquo; questioned the Tinkerer. This time the notes sounded sad, and the rigid metal of the automaton seemed to soften and droop slightly.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the Tinkerer stroking his long, white beard absentmindedly. With a swiftness that belied his age, he turned and strode over to a workbench covered in parchment on which were intricate designs. He picked a couple up and glanced over them, his brow furrowed in concentration. Then, in another burst of movement, he crossed over to a small oak door and wrenched it open, a cascade of light flooding the darkness.</p>

            <p>Chapter 2</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The automaton edged forward to the balcony railing and looked out over the city. It sat nestled in the shoulder of a mountain pass, pressed close to granite walls, as if hiding. A crystal-clear stream wandered around its outskirts, making a lazy half circle before cascading, in a frenzy of white foam, down the rest of the mountain. The river was spanned by several bridges that carried empty roads away from the city and deeper into the mountains. It should have been a beautiful place but something subtle and inscrutable, like an unreachable itch, kept it from such a distinction. In some ways, the city looked too big for itself, like an overstretched wineskin now sitting empty and distorted.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; Came the voice of the Tinkerer. The automaton issued a jumble of low notes in response. They were awe and apprehension</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Precisely what I was thinking,&rdquo; agreed the Tinkerer who was now also watching the city below. The furrows on his face deepened as the tired sight of a decaying city struggled against the surfacing memories of this place in its youth. Behind the startling blue of his eyes, new buildings that smelled of freshly cut pine fought with the reality of sagging roofs and pungent mildew below. The excited chatter of voices at market was drowned out by the silence of empty street corners. The few villagers that remained, moved around with shoulders hunched and feet dragging as if carrying the weight of some unknown heavy thing. The Tinkerer&rsquo;s eyes came to rest on yet another family towing their possession-filled cart away from the city. With their departure, his pristine remembrances turned and fled back into the darker, dustier corners of his mind. He sighed, this time it was heavy and dark, like a cough that has settled in the lungs.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;As he turned to go back inside, he stopped, some far off movement catching his eye. Curiosity aroused, the Tinkerer hurriedly grabbed a looking glass from inside and brought it to his eye. In the distance, he could distinguish a small party of mounted travelers on the road that led from the Capital. The Tinkerer tensed, keeping his eye pressed to the glass. The advancing party seemed mostly unremarkable, they were dressed warmly for the mountain pass, their horses looked tired but well cared for, their packs well provisioned. Nothing obviously set them apart, or marked them special. Nothing aside from the fact that they were all women and, as the Tinkerer noticed with a gasp, their eyes were all a shade of deep, molten gold. He collapsed the looking glass with a quick movement of his wrist and looked down at the little automaton. Things were happening. Fast.</p>

          <p>Chapter 3</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Are you sure Theodora?&rdquo; The question came from one of the three travelers with grey cloaks and golden eyes.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Yes, of course I&rsquo;m sure. I haven&rsquo;t felt such a strange Presence since I was a girl,&rdquo; replied Theodora, the last uttered more to herself than her companions, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no coincidence that it&rsquo;s here of all cities.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Why are we here, then, if you already know? We can do nothing. The Compact forbids it.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;The Compact? What is the Compact but an ineffectual piece of parchment filled with the scribbles of scared men?&rdquo; Theodora responded, gazing distractedly at the city ahead.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;But Thea, what about your uncle?&rdquo; chimed in the other traveler. This remark was met with a tense silence. Theodora turned to the speaker, her motion the bad kind of quiet.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;And what about my uncle?&rdquo; She asked.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;Well&hellip;he has forbidden us! We shouldn&rsquo;t even be here. If we are found out, we will be sent back to the Dungeons!&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;Oh Elayne, you simple girl. You disappoint me. We exist to control, not to be controlled. We serve my uncle because he is a convenient ally. Nothing more. He should lie awake at night sweating with the knowledge that we are free and there is nothing and no one that can stop us. You would do well to remember that.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Elayne responded, head bowed.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;Come. We must make it to the city before the sun goes down.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; As the Sisters continued down the mountain path towards the city, there was something subtle in the way they existed that was dark, that made the very mountains around them seem to shrink away in trepidation. Nothing was obviously wrong about them, indeed upon initial observation it would be excusable to mistake them for an unexceptional group of weary travelers. But on closer inspection, such an evaluation became impossible.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;First, and most obvious, were their golden eyes. Second, was the way the moved. Like snakes swimming through murky water. It looked almost like walking but it was impossible to discern distinct feet or individual steps, their lower halves confusingly disjoint, yet somehow connected. It was like the way everything in a dream can suddenly transform with no loss of continuity. Here one moment, there the next, the in between a jumpy sequence of moments that only barely fit together. Movement like the shadows from a flickering torch. Sinister.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; Before long they were at the city gate. It was a large thing, a pastiche of old oak and wrought iron and, like everything else in the city, seemed to remember grander days. As they passed through, Theodora did something with her hand, and a shimmer flew from her fingertips up to the archway above their heads. As she did this she turned to her companions and spoke.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;Secure the rest of the gates Sisters. No one can know we were here.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; Guinevere and Elayne bowed, turned, and disappeared into the growing darkness.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; The liveliest part of town, indeed the only part of town that showed any signs of life, was the Goat&rsquo;s Head Inn and Pub. It was toward this cacophony of light and sound that Theodora was headed. When she arrived, she stopped just outside the ring of light that spilled out onto the street and brought out from under her robe a golden locket on a golden chain.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;She brought it up to her face slowly, reverently, and blew on it, like she was dusting off an old parchment volume. It sprang open with a faint click and she took out the little ring hidden within. With one hand, she held the ring up to the light while with the other she closed the locket and restored it to its place under her robe.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;The ring was beautiful. Cast in some sort of burnished silver, it seemed to glow a pale blue in the soft light of the rising moon. It was unornamented aside from a single copper gear that sat atop it like a sparkling diamond. As she slid the ring on her finger, the gear started rotating in an ever-faster whir until it was a golden blur. She flipped her hand over so that the palm was facing up, a soft white mist slithering from her fingertips, obscuring her hand, shimmering faintly in the night. With a flex of her hand, the mist collapsed down suddenly into a swirling orb above her palm. With a look at the lonely tower that rose above the city in its silent watch, she tossed the orb in the open door.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been far too long my brother,&rdquo; Theodora muttered into the night.</p>

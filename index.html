          <p>Chapter 1</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;The tired old Tinkerer held his creation up to the light and sighed. It was the sound of something falling into place that previously, frustratingly had absolutely refused to do so. A few golden beams came from high in the workshop somewhere and penetrated the darkness, illuminating the chaos of a space made for creating. The most notable aspect of the space was the number and variety of mechanical parts scattered across every nook and cranny of the workshop. Over here were boxes of gears in all different sizes. Over there, on a wooden workbench, mounded high like a desert sand dune, were thousands of tiny golden wings. The stone walls were dotted with dim lamps that exuded a warm bronze light that didn&rsquo;t do much by way of illumination but made the place feel less like a cave and more like a room. The lamps were spaced evenly, interrupted only by two oak doors that sat facing each other across the workshop. Strewn across the floor were various cranks and levers, axels and wheels and, framed by a box of golden light, a shadow. Shaped like a boy. Moving.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; The cry echoed through the workshop, quiet but for the soft click and whir of moving gears. &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; muttered the Tinkerer who had knelt on the hard stone floor and placed his creation, the source of the aforementioned shadow, on the ground in front of him. He reached forward and inserted a key into the area where a neck would be on this small automaton. The tinkerer gave three good twists, removed the key, and gave the machine a sharp tap on the top of the head. The Tinkerer stood up and watched as his creation began to move about the workshop. While movement is a functional description of the activity in which the small automaton was now engaged, perhaps a more accurate phrase would be toddling. It was an odd sight, almost eerie, startlingly human. Even more alarming perhaps was the look of fatherly pride in the Tinkerer&rsquo;s eyes. It didn&rsquo;t seem possible but, whenever the automaton would come close to a pile of wheels or the leg of a table, it turned around and walked away. It acted as if it could see, which of course, was preposterous.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;After a few minutes of this the Tinkerer cleared his throat and, in the quietness of this small, dark workshop, the automaton stopped to listen. It stared like a curious child at the source of the noise and after a few moments tilted its head.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo; came the deep, slightly husky voice of the Tinkerer. It sounded like aged whiskey. The automaton took a few steps toward the voice and then stopped and issued what sounded like the soft tinkle of small bells brushed by a faint breeze. While not words, the notes sounded like a question and the Tinkerer laughed.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Do you know who you are?&rdquo; questioned the Tinkerer. This time the notes sounded sad, and the rigid metal of the automaton seemed to soften and droop slightly.</p>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the Tinkerer stroking his long, white beard absentmindedly. With a swiftness that belied his age, he turned and strode over to a workbench covered in parchment on which were intricate designs. He picked a couple up and glanced over them, his brow furrowed in concentration. Then, in another burst of movement, he crossed over to a small oak door and wrenched it open, a cascade of light flooding the darkness.</p>

            <p>Chapter 2</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The automaton edged forward to the balcony railing and looked out over the city. It sat nestled in the shoulder of a mountain pass, pressed close to granite walls, as if hiding. A crystal-clear stream wandered around its outskirts, making a lazy half circle before cascading, in a frenzy of white foam, down the rest of the mountain. The river was spanned by several bridges that carried empty roads away from the city and deeper into the mountains. It should have been a beautiful place but something subtle and inscrutable, like an unreachable itch, kept it from such a distinction. In some ways, the city looked too big for itself, like an overstretched wineskin now sitting empty and distorted.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; Came the voice of the Tinkerer. The automaton issued a jumble of low notes in response. They were awe and apprehension</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&ldquo;Precisely what I was thinking,&rdquo; agreed the Tinkerer who was now also watching the city below. The furrows on his face deepened as the tired sight of a decaying city struggled against the surfacing memories of this place in its youth. Behind the startling blue of his eyes, new buildings that smelled of freshly cut pine fought with the reality of sagging roofs and pungent mildew below. The excited chatter of voices at market was drowned out by the silence of empty street corners. The few villagers that remained, moved around with shoulders hunched and feet dragging as if carrying the weight of some unknown heavy thing. The Tinkerer&rsquo;s eyes came to rest on yet another family towing their possession-filled cart away from the city. With their departure, his pristine remembrances turned and fled back into the darker, dustier corners of his mind. He sighed, this time it was heavy and dark, like a cough that has settled in the lungs.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;As he turned to go back inside, he stopped, some far off movement catching his eye. Curiosity aroused, the Tinkerer hurriedly grabbed a looking glass from inside and brought it to his eye. In the distance, he could distinguish a small party of mounted travelers on the road that led from the Capital. The Tinkerer tensed, keeping his eye pressed to the glass. The advancing party seemed mostly unremarkable, they were dressed warmly for the mountain pass, their horses looked tired but well cared for, their packs well provisioned. Nothing obviously set them apart, or marked them special. Nothing aside from the fact that they were all women and, as the Tinkerer noticed with a gasp, their eyes were all a shade of deep, molten gold. He collapsed the looking glass with a quick movement of his wrist and looked down at the little automaton. Things were happening. Fast.</p>
